**Problem Statement:**

**Title:** Predicting Disease Diagnosis from Symptom Data Using Machine Learning

**Objective:** 

Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the diagnosis of a disease based on patient-reported symptoms. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early and accurate disease detection, leading to timely and appropriate treatment.

**Background:**

In the medical field, accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. However, the process of diagnosing a disease can be complex, often requiring the consideration of numerous symptoms and their combinations. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build a predictive model that can assist healthcare providers by offering diagnostic suggestions based on the symptoms reported by patients.

**Dataset:**

The dataset consists of 4920 records and 133 columns, where each row represents a patient and each column represents a symptom. The last column, 'prognosis,' indicates the diagnosed disease. There are 41 unique diseases in the 'prognosis' column. The dataset has no missing values, ensuring the reliability of the data for training the model.

**Features:**

- The dataset includes 132 symptom columns (binary: 0 or 1, indicating the absence or presence of a symptom).
- The target variable is 'prognosis,' which represents the disease diagnosed.

**Challenges:**

1. **High Dimensionality:** With 132 symptoms as features, dimensionality reduction techniques may be required to enhance model performance and interpretability.
2. **Class Imbalance:** The distribution of diseases may be imbalanced, which can affect the model's ability to predict less frequent diseases accurately.
3. **Correlation:** Some symptoms may be highly correlated, which can impact model performance. Feature selection or engineering might be necessary.

**Goals:**

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Understand the distribution of symptoms and diseases.
   - Identify any correlations between symptoms.
   - Check for class imbalance in the 'prognosis' column.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Select the most relevant features for model training.
   - Apply techniques to handle high dimensionality and correlation.

3. **Model Development and Evaluation:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost).
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.
   - Identify the best-performing model for disease prediction.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers to input symptoms and receive diagnostic suggestions.

**Success Criteria:**

A successful model will have:
- High accuracy and F1-score across all classes, ensuring both precision and recall.
- High ROC-AUC score, indicating good discrimination between diseases.
- Practical utility in real-world healthcare settings, aiding in the early and accurate diagnosis of diseases.
